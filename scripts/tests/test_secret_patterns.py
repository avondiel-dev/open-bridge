"""The plaintext-pattern parity check, tested against the drift it is for.

Two layers, and the second is the one that matters. The first walks the real
repo and asserts that every copy of the pattern list agrees today. The second
builds small fake repos where one copy has drifted, in each of the ways these
copies have actually drifted, and asserts that the check says so and names the
file. A guard that has only ever run against a green tree has never been
measured.

The comparison under test is by MARKER, never by regular expression. Two
scanners can spell the same pattern differently and both be right: `ghp_` and
`gh[pousr]_` are one pattern, and a comparison that demanded the literal would
report a gap where there is none. What matters is that no copy is blind to a
shape the others know.

One thing worth saying about the fixtures. Every fake repo gets a COPY of the
real `skills/secrets/engine/patterns.py`, because `compare` imports it as
Python and reads `copies`, `aliases` and `note` off each pattern. A fake source
list would measure a fake.
