"""The object grammar check, tested against the drift it is supposed to catch.

Two layers, as for the secret grammar. The first walks the real repo and asserts
that every copy agrees today and that nothing a session reads before its first
answer points at an object. The second builds small fake repos where one copy
has drifted and asserts that the check says so and names the file. A guard that
only ever runs against a green tree has never been measured.
