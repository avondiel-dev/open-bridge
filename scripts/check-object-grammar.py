"""Hold the copies of the object reference grammar to one source, and keep
object references out of everything a session reads before its first answer.

THE GRAMMAR. `infra/object-stores/_schema.yaml` is the source: the `name`
pattern (the shape of a store name), the `backend` enum, and `$defs/reference`
(object://<store>/<key>). Two other places carry it as a literal rather than a
read, on purpose:

* `skills/object-store/objstore/refs.py` parses references, and the skill has
  to keep working when its directory is lifted out of the repo on its own.
* `infra/object-stores/_template.yaml` tells the person writing a declaration
  which backends exist.

The schema is also checked against itself: its reference pattern and its
address pattern have to use the same store shape as its name pattern.

Text is compared where text is the thing (the backend list, the store shape,
the scheme). The reference itself is compared by BEHAVIOUR: a fixed list of
sample references goes through the schema's pattern and through the resolver's
own `parse`, and every answer has to match. A first version compared constants
only, while the parser used a regular expression of its own that no constant
fed, so a changed parser passed; and the schema accepted `object://s/../x`,
which the parser refused, from the first commit on.

docs/object-store.md decided this from its first commit, because the secret
grammar did not: its six copies had drifted apart before anything compared
them, and `scripts/check-secret-grammar.py` was written afterwards.

THE PLACEMENT. The ADR's last content rule is a hard never: a store may hold
what a session opens later, never what a session needs to start. So no FILE on
the always-on surface may carry a concrete reference. "Always-on" is whatever
`scripts/measure-context.py` measures, the one definition every other guard
uses, minus its `cmd:` items: those are the output of a command run at session
start (the work log slice, the config slice), and a log row that MENTIONS where
a recording went is the entry tracking its reference, which the ADR asks for,
not content a session needs to start. A placeholder such as
object://<store>/<key> is grammar, not a reference.

    python3 scripts/check-object-grammar.py            # compare, report, exit non-zero on a finding
    python3 scripts/check-object-grammar.py --json     # the same as data
    python3 scripts/check-object-grammar.py --mutate   # prove both checks bite
