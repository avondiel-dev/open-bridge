"""Instance data: out of a public clone by default, backed up by a private one, never a secret.

WHY THIS EXISTS. An instance's config (personas, accounts, secret stores,
channels, workloads, `bridge-config.yaml`, ...) and its `work/memory/` are the
part of a Bridge that no upstream can give back. Until 2026-09-25 the shipped
`.gitignore` ignored them family by family, with no way back for a private
instance short of editing a CORE file: a file already tracked stayed tracked, a
NEW one was left out of every commit and every backup without a word. A leak
attempt fails loudly at the push guard; a lost backup fails silently.

THE MODEL, three layers:

1. The shipped `.gitignore` carries the block `shipped_patterns()` prints. It
   is GENERIC (`/identity/*/*.yaml`), so a family added tomorrow is covered,
   and it protects a clone before anything at all has run in it.
2. On a PRIVATE origin, `arm` writes `identity/.gitignore`, `infra/.gitignore`,
   `workflow/.gitignore` and `work/.gitignore`, which negate those patterns: a
   deeper .gitignore wins over the root one. They are USER files and get
   committed with the instance, so a fresh clone of the private repo is right
   before setup ran there. The root files (`bridge-config.yaml`, ...) cannot be
   negated below the root, so `arm` stages them once with `git add -f` on a
   user/* branch; once tracked, being ignored no longer matters. `arm` never
   deletes a negation file: gh being offline makes a private origin look
   unknown, and deleting then would drop the backup.
3. What enters a commit is scanned. `scan-staged` reads the INDEX of every
   instance file and template and refuses a credential, so the backup can
   never be the leak. Personal data is not a credential: a persona carries a
   tax id by design.

The origin is classified by `scripts/lib/remote-class.sh`, the classifier the
push guard sources, so the two never disagree about the same remote.

    python3 scripts/user-data.py patterns      # the block the shipped .gitignore carries
    python3 scripts/user-data.py arm           # private origin: write negations, stage root files
    python3 scripts/user-data.py check         # private origin, instance data still ignored? (exit 1)
