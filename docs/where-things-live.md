# Where things live

You have a question right now and do not know which file answers it. Find the
question below; the right column is the file, with a section where the file is
long. Two other documents sound similar and answer something else:
[`rules/knowledge-growth.md`](../rules/knowledge-growth.md) says where **new**
knowledge should go, and [`docs/structure.md`](structure.md) says how the tree is
**laid out**. Neither helps when you already have the question.

The answer usually exists already, often in a reference file of a skill nobody
thought to open. Searching finds it only when you already know the words it was
written in, which is why this map is written in the words of the question instead.

**Your question is not here?** Answer it, then propose the row: the question the
way you would have asked it, the file that answered it. A CORE answer goes into
this file, an answer that lives in this instance goes into the instance file
(§ Adding rows). Answering and leaving the map as it was means the next person
searches again.

## Configuration

| Question | Where |
|---|---|
| Which fields does a new config file of a given type take? | [`rules/file-creation.md`](../rules/file-creation.md#where-templates-live-lookup-table), then that type's `_template.yaml` and `_schema.yaml` |
| Which folder does a new kind of config go in? | [`docs/structure.md`](structure.md#cluster-wrappers--default-to-folder) |

## Adding rows

**CORE rows** live in this file and ship with open-bridge. **Instance rows** live
in `work/where-things-live.md`, a file CORE never ships: the answers to an
instance's own questions sit in its own skills, config and external stores, and
none of that may travel upstream. `work/` is instance content as a whole folder,
so every router already keeps the file home (promote, sync, contribute, the
push guard), and because upstream never writes it, an upstream merge never
touches an instance's rows. Create it the first time you need it, with the same
two-column table; links are relative to `work/`:

```markdown
# Where things live: this instance

| Question | Where |
|---|---|
| Which wiki holds the customer runbooks? | [runbooks](https://wiki.example.org/runbooks) |
| Which field values does our main board take? | [`workflow/projects/main.yaml`](../workflow/projects/main.yaml) |
```

Three rules for every row, in either file:

1. **The left column is a question**, opening the way a question does (how, what,
   where, which, may, does, ...) and ending in `?`, in the words somebody who is
   stuck would use. "How do I write a comment that renders on the tracker?", not
   "Tracker conventions". A reader should recognise their own question, not deduce
   it. This is the property that decays first.
2. **The right column is a link** that resolves, with a `#section` where the file
   is long. An external store is a link too.
3. **An instance row adds a question**; it does not repeat a CORE one. When the
   instance answers a CORE question differently, that is a fork of the answer and
   belongs in the file the CORE row points at.

`python3 scripts/check-where-things-live.py` holds both files to these rules: a
row that is not a question, a link that does not resolve (or resolves only on a
case-insensitive disk, or outside the repository), an anchor the target does not
have, and a question asked twice. CI and `bridge-audit` Check 15 both run it, on
the CORE file and, where it exists, the instance file. The question test is
mechanical: it catches "Tracker conventions" and "Tracker conventions?", not a
question nobody would actually ask, so a reviewer still reads the left column.

Rows are written by people who got stuck, not generated from the tree. A
generated table of contents is the thing this map deliberately is not.
