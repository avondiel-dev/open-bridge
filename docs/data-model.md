# Data model

The layout of a Bridge is described in four places, each from its own angle:
[`structure.md`](structure.md) (the tree), [`extension-model.md`](extension-model.md)
(CORE and USER), [`org-overlays.md`](org-overlays.md) (the organisation layer) and
[`context-index.md`](context-index.md) (what a session reads first). This page is
the one picture across all four, for anyone about to add an object type or trying
to see where a piece of data belongs.

It answers four questions: which data is core, which is per organisation and which
is per user; which objects live in each of those islands; how they reference each
other; and in which kind of store each one lives. The tables below are generated
from [`data-model.yaml`](data-model.yaml), and `python3 scripts/data-model.py`
holds that file to the tree: every config family the tree has appears in it
exactly once.

## Three islands

| Island | Where it lives | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| **core** | `bks-lab/open-bridge`, the default branch | Templates, schemas, skills, rules, docs and scripts. Ships to every instance. |
| **org** | an organisation's overlay repository | Shared contexts, project boards, recipient groups, org skills and rules, an ecosystem fragment. Materialized into each member's instance. |
| **user** | the instance's `user/<name>` branch, on a private origin | Every entry under the cluster wrappers, `work/`, `bridge-config.yaml`, the registry. Never reaches a public upstream. |

Which island a file belongs to is decided by where it lives, not by a tag you can
forget: the folder, the `_` prefix of templates and schemas, and a `scope:` field
only where a folder cannot say it (skills, rules, sub-agents). The rules are in
`AGENTS.md`, section "Scope: structural, not declarative".

## How data moves between the islands

  core["core<br>open-bridge"]
  org["org<br>overlay repository"]
  user["user<br>your instance"]
  secrets["secret stores<br>keychain, keepass,<br>1password, azure-keyvault"]
  local["outside git<br>.bridge/ caches, imports/"]
  core -- "merge upstream, or the daily guarded auto-merge" --> user
  org -- "/overlay sync, or the daily auto-sync" --> user
  user -- "/promote, /contribute: scope core" --> core
  user -- "/promote: scope org" --> org
  user -. "reference URI only" .-> secrets
  user -. "clones and caches" .-> local
```

- **core to user.** `git merge upstream/main`, or `scripts/upstream-autoupdate.sh`
  as a daily job that merges only when a clean tree and a conflict-free
  `git merge-tree` allow it.
- **org to user.** `scripts/overlay.py sync`, or `scripts/overlay-autosync.sh`
  unattended: configuration and updates to files already accepted are applied, a
  behavioural file arriving for the first time waits for one explicit yes, and a
  conflict with a local edit or a deletion holds the overlay for a person.
- **user to core or org.** `/promote` and `/contribute` route every file by its
  island, through a content scan that refuses personal data
  (`rules/promote-safety.md`).
- **secrets.** An entry holds a reference URI, never a value
  (`rules/secret-placement.md`). The value stays in its store.

## What a session reads, and when

A session does not read the whole tree. It reads a small, measured set before its
first answer, and opens everything else when the work names it. The ring in the
concept section of the [landing page](https://bks-lab.github.io/open-bridge/#concept)
draws exactly this, from the same file as the tables below:

1. **The centre** is the session.
2. **The first ring** is what every session reads before its first answer. Its size
   has a declared ceiling in `context-budget.yaml`, enforced by
   `scripts/measure-context.py`.
3. **The second ring** holds the config families, one dot each. A filled dot means
   something of that family is read at session start (a listing, an index, a slice);
   a hollow dot means it is opened when the work names it.
   `scripts/check-reachability.py` makes sure every family is at least named where
   a session will see it, so "when named" never turns into "never".
4. **Beyond it** are the references between entries (`persona_ref`, `context_ref`,
   `remote_ref` and the rest), the path the agent walks after the first hop.
   `scripts/check-edges.py` holds each one to resolving.
5. **Outside the dashed line** is what never enters git: secret stores and object
   stores, reached by URI, and local caches. Why content that is not
   configuration gets a store of its own: [`object-store.md`](object-store.md).

## The tables

<!-- data-model:table:start (generated by scripts/data-model.py from docs/data-model.yaml; edit the yaml, then run it with --write) -->
#### Read before the first answer

| Item | What it is |
|---|---|
| AGENTS.md | The operating manual, @-imported through CLAUDE.md (or the tool's own wrapper). |
| SOUL/IDENTITY | identity/agent/SOUL.md and IDENTITY.md, @-imported once onboarding has seeded them. |
| config slice | `python3 scripts/bridge-config.py --session`: the six bridge-config.yaml blocks a session needs; the others are read by the skill that owns them. |
| registry card | `python3 scripts/context-index.py ecosystem.yaml`: the settings plus one line per entry; an entry itself comes with `--get <name>` (docs/context-index.md). |
| order index | `python3 scripts/standing-orders.py --index`, plus the bodies of the orders marked `load: eager`. |
| log + board | `python3 scripts/worklog.py --recent 3` and work/board.md, never the whole log. |
| skill list | Name and description of every skill, injected by the harness (measured as listing:skills). |
| agent list | Name and description of every sub-agent, injected by the harness (measured as listing:agents). |

#### The config families

#### Beside the families

| File | What it is | Island | Lives in |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bridge-config.yaml` | the instance's settings; a session reads six of its blocks | user | instance data |
| `ecosystem.yaml` | the repo registry, read as a card with one entry on demand | user | instance data |
| `ecosystem.<name>.yaml` | a registry fragment, for example an organisation's | org or user | instance data<br>org overlay |
| `overlays.lock.yaml` | which overlay files were materialized, at which revision | user | instance data |
| `context-budget.yaml` | the declared ceiling for what every session reads | core | open-bridge (CORE) |
| `context-budget.user.yaml` | an instance's own caps for its own always-on files | user | instance data |
| `DESIGN.md` | the design tokens every generated visual reads | core | open-bridge (CORE) |
| `.bridge/` | the overlay cache, the workspace clones and the object read cache | user | outside git |
| `imports/` | incoming files before they are filed | user | outside git |
| `object://<store>/<key>` | content that is not configuration: recordings, filed documents, exports | user | an object store |

#### The stores

| Lives in | Meaning |
|---|---|
| open-bridge (CORE) | Tracked in open-bridge and shipped to every instance on the next merge. |
| your user branch | Tracked on the instance's own user/* branch, which only ever goes to a private origin (rules/push-guard.md). |
| instance data | Personal or instance-specific data. Ignored by the shipped .gitignore for every clone; a private origin re-allows it by writing negation files (scripts/user-data.py arm), then commits it with the rest of your work. |
| org overlay | Materialized from an organisation's overlay repository and recorded in overlays.lock.yaml (docs/org-overlays.md). |
| outside git | Never in a repository: a secret store reached by URI (rules/secret-placement.md), or a local cache or clone under .bridge/. |
| an object store | Never in a repository: bytes an entry reaches by an object:// reference, through a declaration in infra/object-stores/ (docs/object-store.md). A local directory can be one. |

## Adding an object type

1. Create the family folder with its `_template.yaml` (and `_schema.yaml` where
   entries are validated), following `rules/file-creation.md`.
2. Describe it in `docs/data-model.yaml`. A family only your instance has goes into
   `work/data-model.yaml` instead, in the same shape: `work/` is USER by folder, so
   the row never promotes and a fork can describe its own families without touching
   a CORE file.
3. Run `python3 scripts/data-model.py --write` to regenerate the tables and the ring,
   then name the family where a session will find it (`scripts/check-reachability.py`
   says where that is).

`python3 scripts/data-model.py` fails when a family has no row, when one has two,
when a row names a folder the tree does not have, and when either generated block
was edited by hand. `--mutate` proves each of those checks can fail.
