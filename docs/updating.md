# Updating your Bridge

A Bridge has up to three inbound channels and one outbound one:

| Direction | What moves | How |
|---|---|---|
| CORE to you | skills, rules, scripts, docs, templates from `bks-lab/open-bridge` | `git merge upstream/main`, by hand or by the daily job |
| org to you | your organisation's shared config, if you subscribe to an overlay | the `bridge-overlay` skill, by hand or by the daily job |
| you to CORE | a generic fix you made to a CORE file | `/bridge-promote` or `/bridge-contribute`, as a fork PR |

Why the first one is safe at all: CORE and your USER data touch disjoint paths.
Your data lives on `user/{name}` in files CORE never ships, so a CORE merge does
not meet your edits. The split is described in
[extension-model.md](extension-model.md).

## Manually

On your `user/{name}` branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

That is the whole update. It stays conflict-free as long as you have not edited
a CORE file and kept the edit (see *Fixing CORE* below).

A copy made with GitHub's *Use this template* button shares no history with this
repo, so its **first** merge needs `git merge --allow-unrelated-histories
upstream/main` once. Details: [install.md](install.md).

Before a merge, `python3 scripts/bridge-divergence-check.py` lists every CORE
file you changed locally and flags the ones upstream changed too.

**If your instance is private**, there is nothing to hand-edit after a merge. The shipped
root `.gitignore` ignores instance data for every clone, and on a private origin
`scripts/user-data.py arm` (run by `bin/setup`) re-allows your own by writing
`identity/.gitignore`, `infra/.gitignore`, `workflow/.gitignore` and `work/.gitignore`
([`docs/structure.md`](structure.md#gitignore-policy)). If your own `.gitignore` had blocks
commented out from an earlier version of this policy, a merge of an update to this file may
conflict in that region: resolve it by taking upstream's version, then run `bin/setup` (it
writes the four negation files) and commit them. `python3 scripts/user-data.py check`
confirms nothing of yours is still ignored afterward.

## Unattended, once a day

[`scripts/upstream-autoupdate.sh`](../scripts/upstream-autoupdate.sh) merges
upstream CORE into your branch only when it can show the merge is safe. Every
guard fails closed: an error or an unknown state skips the merge instead of
risking a bad one. All three must pass:

1. the current branch is a `user/*` branch;
2. there are no uncommitted changes to tracked files;
3. `git merge-tree` predicts zero conflicts (read from its exit code).

It writes the outcome to `work/upstream-status.md` (up to date, merged, skipped
with the reason, or failed and aborted). Independently of the job, `/briefing`
reports how far behind CORE and each subscribed overlay you are, when your
`bridge-config.yaml` lists `upstreams:`.
After a successful merge it also fast-forwards the core branch on your private
`origin`, so the mirror keeps pace with what was merged; the push goes through
the normal `pre-push` guard. Set `SIGNAL_ACCOUNT` and `SIGNAL_RECIPIENT` and it
sends a short Signal message per outcome.

Install it as a daily job with one command:

```bash
scripts/install-upstream-autoupdate.sh           # CORE, daily at 07:00
scripts/install-upstream-autoupdate.sh --print   # show the job, install nothing
```

The installer binds to wherever the repo currently is (re-run it after moving
the repo), loads the job, and then runs it once in the real scheduler context to
prove it works instead of assuming so. It targets macOS launchd. On another OS,
schedule `scripts/upstream-autoupdate.sh` with cron or a systemd timer, or
declare it as a workload ([workloads.md](workloads.md)).

## Org overlays

If your organisation publishes an overlay, the `bridge-overlay` skill subscribes
to it by git URL and materialises its files as copies, never touching CORE and
never overwriting your own edits (a 3-way merge decides). Updating is
`/bridge-overlay sync` in Claude Code.

The unattended counterpart runs after the CORE job:

```bash
scripts/install-upstream-autoupdate.sh --overlays   # daily at 07:15
```

It applies an overlay only when the whole plan needs nobody. A conflict with a
local edit, or a file it would delete, holds that overlay untouched until you
resolve it interactively. A behavioural file (a skill, an agent, a standing
order) arriving for the first time waits for one explicit yes. The full table
and the reasoning: [org-overlays.md](org-overlays.md).

## Fixing CORE without lasting divergence

The conflict-free guarantee breaks the moment you edit a CORE file on your
`user/*` branch and keep the edit: every upstream change to that file becomes a
conflict, and the daily job starts skipping. The discipline is in
[`rules/core-fix-workflow.md`](../rules/core-fix-workflow.md), in short:

- **Promote and reconverge (default).** Make the fix, send it upstream with
  `/bridge-promote` (commits) or `/bridge-contribute` (files). Once it is merged
  there, the next `git merge upstream/main` brings back identical content and
  your divergence dissolves.
- **Feature branch.** For a larger change, branch off the core branch, build and
  PR from there, and keep `user/*` free of the edit until it lands.
- **Need different behaviour only for you?** Add a `scope: user` or `scope: org`
  skill, rule or config knob that the generic CORE reads, instead of forking the
  CORE file.

Both promote paths run a mandatory content-safety scan and open a fork-based PR
with a DCO sign-off; they never push to the public repo directly. See
[`rules/promote-safety.md`](../rules/promote-safety.md).
